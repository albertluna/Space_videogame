Project focused on creating graphics for 3D video games. The objective was to build a pixel shader and a fragment shader from scratch to later develop a mini-game.
The experimentation involved testing various types of shaders, from flat shading, to Pong shading and others.


INTRUCTIONS:Press the space button to start playing.
To move around the game, you can use WASD or the arrow keys.
When the game over or victory screen appears, press the R button to restart.

EXPLANATION:
The game features a kamikaze ship that must collide with the central ship to win. Around it, there are 3 protective ships. The player must avoid colliding with the protective ships and ultimately collide with the central ship to win the game.
If the player tries to escape the combat zone, they will be automatically redirected to the combat zone. Escape is not allowed.
